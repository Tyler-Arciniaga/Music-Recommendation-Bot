Backend:
    Python:
    - need a way for users to input their spotify account credentials to connect to spotify API (most likely will require JSON)
        - actually required Oauth to connect to spotify account
    - use "SPOTIPY" and Oauth

    - Notes:
        - validating API token should be automated into it's own method
        - ideally secret key should be a fixed string and then stored somewhere secure
        - port 5000 has conflict on mac, make sure to use a different port instead, I used port 8000
        - safari web developers tool, specifically the network tab view is super helpful (shows where the website is facing error and what the error is)
